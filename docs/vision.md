# LifePilot â€“ Why This Exists

Theyâ€™re trying to erase the middle class â€” one payday loan, late fee, and credit trap at a time.

**LifePilot** exists to fight that.

This isnâ€™t just an app. Itâ€™s a counter-system. A way to give people the tools to:

- Take control of their money
- Set goals *they* care about
- Stop being prey to predatory banks

We believe:
- Budgeting shouldnâ€™t feel like punishment
- AI should serve people, not manipulate them
- Planning your life shouldnâ€™t require $200/hr coaching

This is built for the people who were never meant to win in the current system.

Letâ€™s give them a way out.
